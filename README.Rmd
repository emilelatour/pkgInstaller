# pkgInstaller

The goal of pkgInstaller is to be a stand alone space for some functions that are helpful when installing and managing packages.

One of the main functions, `install_missing_pkg`, borrows heavily from [INSTALLING MISSING PACKAGES FROM BIOCONDUCTOR, CRAN AND GITHUB](https://www.eokodie.com/blog/installing-missing-packages-from-bioconductor-cran-and-github/). This function requires that Bioconductor be installed. This package was created to get this function and dependency out of one of my other packages.

## Installation

You can install the development version of pkgInstaller from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("pkgInstaller")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!
